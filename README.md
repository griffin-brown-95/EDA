This is my individual repository for the Home Credit Project for IS 6812, Capstone 1. 

The EDA is my initial notebook written in R.

The individual_modeling_home_credit file is written in Python. There isn't as much text in this notebook, 
but it shows the steps for cleaning and processing data and scores for each test. There were some models 
created that I did not get to totally get to finish, like an ANN model.
